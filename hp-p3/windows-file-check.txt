Using System File Checker (SFC) and DISM

This method uses built-in command-line tools to scan and repair system files. 
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator:
Search for "cmd" in the start menu, right-click on Command Prompt, and select "Run as administrator". 

2. Run SFC:
Type sfc /scannow into the command prompt and press Enter. This will scan for and attempt to repair corrupted system files. 

3. Run DISM:
If SFC finds issues or doesn't fully resolve them, type DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth and press Enter. 

4. Reboot:
Restart your computer after the commands have finished.
